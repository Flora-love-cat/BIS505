# insert code block: Cmd+Option+I


# R Markdown

**R** Markdown is a unified authoring framework and reporting medium for data analysis that combines code, results, and commentary in one stand-alone document.  **R** Markdown provides an alternative to saving **R** code in an **R** script file. When running code from a script file, your numerical output is printed to the *Console* window and graphical output is generally sent to the *Plot* tab.  When creating your lab reports, you would traditionally write your code in an **R** script file, execute the code, then copy and paste the relevant output to a Word document, where you would also type up your interpretation and commentary.  The benefit of using **R** Markdown is that you can use a single **R** Markdown file to both save your code, execute that code, and generate high quality reports. **R** Markdown documents are fully reproducible and support many different output formats that can easily be shared with others. 

We will use **R** Markdown documents in our **R** labs. You will follow an **R** Markdown document during the lab presentation and you will use an **R** Markdown document to conduct your analyses and describe your findings in your lab reports. This file is an **R** Markdown file (notice that the file name has the extension .Rmd). 


# Getting Started with R Markdown

To get **R** Markdown working in **RStudio**, you need to first download the `rmarkdown` package. Installing `rmarkdown` will also install the `knitr` package, which we will use. Please also install the `dplyr` and `ggplot2` packages. Download and install packages in your **R** library by running the following code in the **R** or **RStudio** *Console*:

```
install.packages("rmarkdown")
install.packages("dplyr")
install.packages("ggplot2")
```

To create a new **R** Markdown file (.Rmd) in **RStudio**, navigate to `“File” > "New File" > “R Markdown”`.  Alternatively, click on the white square with a green + and select "R Markdown" from the drop-down menu. For now, we will generate out output in an .html format. This means that when we execute (or render or "knit") our .Rmd file, it will create a local .html file that is saved in the same directory that contains your .Rmd file. **RStudio** will open a window that displays the rendered file.

<center><img src="https://www.biostats.net/resources/Lab1-1.png" width="75%"></center><br>

The newly created .Rmd file is a generic template with basic instructions. When you eventually create your own **R** Markdown document, you can delete the sample text below the header to begin from scratch. In this lab, we will work through this .Rmd file.

*Note*: It is possible to send your results to a PDF or a Word document instead. **RStudio** does not build PDF and Word documents from scratch. You will need to have a distribution of LaTeX installed on your computer to make PDFs and Microsoft Word (or a similar program) installed to make Word files. **Knitting to .html is perfectly fine in this course and seems to work for everyone** (if you have the necessary packages installed). If you would like to try knitting to .pdf, there are instructions for Mac users <a href="https://medium.com/@sorenlind/create-pdf-reports-using-r-r-markdown-latex-and-knitr-on-macos-high-sierra-e7b5705c9fd">here</a> and Windows users <a href="https://medium.com/@sorenlind/create-pdf-reports-using-r-r-markdown-latex-and-knitr-on-windows-10-952b0c48bfa9">here</a>. 


# Rendering (Knitting) the R Markdown Document

To compile the **R** Markdown document, click the `Knit` button in the toolbar or use the keyboard shortcut Ctrl + Shift + K (Cmd + Shift + K on macOS).  This will render the file and display the output of your .Rmd file in a new window. All of the code chunks will be executed and a .html file will be saved in the same folder where you saved your .Rmd file.  Note that if you have never saved your .Rmd file, you will be prompted to save the file before it will compile.  

<center><img src="https://www.biostats.net/resources/Lab1-2.png" width="75%"></center><br>


# Structure of the R Markdown Document

Notice that an **R** Markdown file contains three types of content:

1. A header at the top of this file containing metadata to configure the R Markdown build process. 
2. Markdown text with simple formatting.
3. **R** code chunks surrounded by three "back-ticks", <code>```</code>, which will generate numerical or graphical results.

<center><img src="https://www.biostats.net/resources/Lab1-3.png" width="60%"></center><br>


# Header

At the top of any **R** Markdown script is the header that contains the metadata of the document. The header uses three dashes (`---`) to separate directives from document content. By default, the header includes the document title, author, date, and output format (HTML, here, requested by specifying `output: html_document` in the header). You can omit the author and date, but should always include a title and output format. A PDF is created by instead specifying `output: pdf_document`, and a Word file is created by specifying `output: word_document`. There are many other options that can be specified in the header, for example,


**Table of Contents**

You can add a table of contents (TOC) using the `toc` option and specify the depth of headers using the `toc_depth` option. More on headers, below, but if the depth not specified, TOC depth defaults to 3, which will show level 1, 2, and 3 headers.

```
---
title: "Example"
output:
  html_document:
    toc: true
    toc_depth: 2
---
```

**Section Numbering**

You can add section numbering to headers using the `number_sections` option:

```
---
title: "Example"
output:
  html_document:
    toc: true
    number_sections: true
---
```

**HTML Appearance**

There are several options that control the appearance of HTML documents:

`theme` specifies the theme to use for the page. There are 13 themes in addition to the `default` theme that can be applied to your document without installing any additional packages. Valid themes include default, cerulean, journal, flatly, darkly, readable, spacelab, united, cosmo, lumen, paper, sandstone, simplex, and yeti. [This site](https://www.datadreaming.org/post/r-markdown-theme-gallery/) gives examples of most of the themes. If you do not specify a theme, the `default` theme is used. Change the theme on an indented line under `html_document` in the header:

```
---
title: "Example"
output:
  html_document:
    theme: united
---
```

`highlight` specifies the **R** syntax highlighting style. Supported styles include default, tango, pygments, kate, monochrome, espresso, zenburn, haddock, breezedark, and textmate. 

```
---
title: "Example"
output:
  html_document:
    theme: united
    highlight: tango
---
```

*Note*: Additional templates are available in the `prettydoc` and `rmdformats` packages.


# Markdown Text

Markdown syntax can be used to format the text in an **R** Markdown document. Some common formatting commands are shown below.

**Bulleted List**

Unordered list items start with *, -, or +.  You can nest lists by indenting the sub-list, e.g.,

* Item 1
* Item 2
    * Sub-item 2a
    * Sub-item 2b
    
```
* Item 1
* Item 2
    * Sub-item 2a
    * Sub-item 2b
```

----

<span style="color: #2980B9;">**Exercise**: Create an **R** Markdown bulleted to do list for yourself below.</span> 

----

<details><summary>Answer:</summary>

* Order groceries
* Review some R coding
* Read chapters 2 and 3
* Send birthday card to Caroline
* Submit letter of intent

</details>  
\  
  

**Numbered List**

You can also nest bulleted lists within numbered lists, e.g., 

1. Item 1  
    i). Sub-item 1  
2. Item 2
    + Sub-item 2a
    + Sub-item 2b

```
1. Item 1  
    i). Sub-item 1  
2. Item 2
    + Sub-item 2a
    + Sub-item 2b
```

**Headers**

Section headers are written after a number of pound signs, e.g.,

```
# Level 1 Header

## Level 2 Header

### Level 3 Header
```

**Formatting**

*Italic text* or _Italic text_  
**Bold text** or __Bold text__  
superscript^2^  
subscript~1~   
~~strikethrough~~  
`verbatim code`   

>block quote (requires blank line above)

```
*Italic text* or _Italic text_
**Bold text** or __Bold text__
superscript^2^
subscript~1~   
~~strikethrough~~  
`verbatim code`  

>block quote (requires blank line above)
```

**Link**

[Hyperlinks](https://www.rstudio.com) are created using the syntax `[link](https://www.rstudio.com)`  

**Manual Line Breaks**

*Option 1*: Insert a blank line after your line break

*Option 2*: End a line with two or more spaces, e.g., 

I want to insert a line break here  
and here  
.

*Option 3*: Use the `<br>` command

Line<br>
break

```
Line<br>
break
```

**Horizontal Line**

Three or more asterisks or dashes will produce a horizontal line:

----

```
****

----
```

**Comments**

<!--This text comment will not display in the rendered html-->

```
<!--This text comment will not display in the rendered html-->
```


# Manually Creating a Table ("Pipe Table")

You can create a simple formatted table using pipes (i.e., vertical bars, `|`) to separate the table cells. The table begins with a header row, and the columns are each separated by a pipe `|`.  The header row is separated from the remaining rows by hyphens `---`. The row containing the hyphens can be used to format the alignment of the column using the colon symbol, `:`.  The default cell alignment is left alignment, which may also be specified using `:---`. Right-alignment is requested using `---:` and center-alignment is requested using `:---:`.  A hard return, followed by a `:` and text creates a table description. 

```
| Right | Left | Default | Center |
|------:|:-----|---------|:------:|
| 12 | 12 | 12 | 12 |
| 123 | 123 | 123 | 123 |
| 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 |

: Table description
```

| Right | Left | Default | Center |
|------:|:-----|---------|:------:|
| 12 | 12 | 12 | 12 |
| 123 | 123 | 123 | 123 |
| 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 |

: Table description


# R Code Chunks

Embed **R** code into the report using code chunks. The code chunks are where we will conduct our data analysis. **R** will run the code and include the results under the printed code chunk when it renders the report. Code chunks should be enclosed by three ticks, <code>```</code>.  

The code chunk begins with <code>```\{r\}</code>, e.g., (look at the .Rmd file to see the syntax of the code chunk below)

```{r}
# Fahrenheit to Celsius conversion
tempf <- 73
tempc <- (tempf-32)*5/9
tempc
```

Note that objects created in earlier code chunks can be directly referenced in subsequent code chunks (i.e., no need to re-define a variable over and over again in each code chunk). Below, I'm referencing the variable `tempc` that I created in the code chunk above. 

```{r}
round(tempc, 2)
```


**Run Individual Code Chunk in RStudio**

Run an individual chunk of code by placing your cursor inside the code chunk and clicking on the `Run` button in the toolbar. Select `"Run" > "Run Current Chunk"`. Alternatively, select the green run button <span style="color:green">&#9654;</span> in the upper right-hand corner of the individual code chunk to run the current chunk. By default, any printed results will appear immediately below the code chunk. This is equivalent to running those lines of code in the **R** *Console*, except that the results will appear below your code chunk instead of in the *Console* window. 

<center><img src="https://www.biostats.net/resources/Lab1-6.png" width="75%"></center><br>

----

<span style="color: #2980B9;">**Exercise**: If you haven't already done so, run the *Fahrenheit to Celsius conversion* code chunks above using the green run button in those chunks.</span> 

----
  
Notice that when we run individual code chunks, variables or objects we create will appear in the *Environment* tab of **RStudio** (usually the upper right-hand panel of **RStudio**). However, when we knit a document, **R** will run all of the code chunks in your file, but will not store the objects that are created in the .Rmd file in your **R** session's Global Environment. 


**New Code Chunk**

To insert an **R** code chunk, click on the `Insert` button in the toolbar or use the keyboard shortcut Ctrl + Alt + I (Cmd + Option + I on macOS).

<center><img src="https://www.biostats.net/resources/Lab1-5.png" width="75%"></center><br>


**Importing Data Sets and Packages**

To analyze an external data set, you must import or read in the data. I generally set my WD and read in any data sets in an **R** code chunk at the *beginning* of my .Rmd document (see **code chunk 3** at the beginning of this .Rmd document). Below, is the code used to read in the Framingham Heart Study data from the participants' first examination period contained in the data file `fhs_exam1.csv`. This code assumes the CSV file is saved in the `C:\BIS_505\LABS\Lab0` folder on your computer, but you would change the path to point to your `Lab0` folder that contains `fhs_exam1.csv`. Note that the code below is commented so that it does not run and attempt to access a potentially non-existent folder on your machine. 

```{r}
# Uncomment and map to your Lab0 folder; csv file should be saved in your WD
# setwd("C:\\BIS_505\\LABS\\Lab0")  
# fhs <- read.csv("fhs_exam1.csv")  
```

----

<span style="color: #2980B9;">**Exercise**: If you haven't already done so, go up to **code chunk 3** at the beginning of this .Rmd document and run that code chunk using the green run button in the upper right of the code chunk. After running that code chunk, you should see the `fhs` data frame object in the *Environment* tab of **RStudio**.</span> 

----

<details><summary>Answer:</summary>

> `fhs` exists in my Global Environment.
</details>  
\  
  
  
After the data set is imported, we can perform analyses using the data in subsequent code chunks. Again, if you are only viewing your results in the rendered web page after knitting your document, then you do not have to individually run **code chunk 3**. But if you want to run individual code chunks without knitting (i.e., send individual lines of code to the *Console*), then the `fhs` data frame must exist in your Global Environment before you can run the individual code chunks below. 
  
```{r}
names(fhs)
summary(fhs$TOTCHOL)
```

Similarly, if you are using any packages in your analysis, the packages must be loaded in the .Rmd file using `library()` as in a normal **R** script.  See **code chunk 2** at the beginning of this .Rmd document where the `dplyr`, `knitr`, and `ggplot2`^[https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/] packages are loaded.  

----

<span style="color: #2980B9;">**Exercise**: Report the dimensions of the `fhs` data frame (number of rows, number of columns).</span> 

----

<details><summary>Answer:</summary>

```{r}
dim(fhs)
```

> The data frame `fhs` contains 4434 rows and 36 columns.
</details>  
\  
  
  
**Customizing R Output**

Chunk output can be customized with arguments set in the `{r ...}` of a chunk header, with arguments separated by a comma.  For example, `{r, echo=FALSE}` will prevent the **R** code in that particular code chunk from appearing in the final rendered document. Note, however, that the output will be displayed (useful when you do not want the reader to see your code, but want to display the results in your final report).  `{r, include=FALSE}` will have **R** evaluate the chunk, but neither the **R** code nor the output will be displayed in the final document. This option is useful when loading libraries or importing data. Some commonly-used code chunk options are given in the table below:

Option (default)   |  Description                                                                                        |
:-----------------:|:----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
`echo=TRUE`        | Code chunk displayed in output document? (output is displayed)                                      |
`eval=TRUE`        | Code chunk evaluated (run)?                                                                         |
`include=TRUE`     | Code and results included in final report?                                                          |
`collapse=FALSE`   | Collapse code and output into a single block?                                                       |
`message=TRUE`     | Display messages generated by the code in final report?                                             | 
`warning=TRUE`     | Display warnings in final report?                                                                   |
`error=FALSE`      | Display errors in final report? (default =FALSE will cause rendering to stop if error encountered)  |
`cache=FALSE`      | Cache results for future renders?                                                                   |
`comment="##"`     | Comment character that prefaces printed results                                                     |
`results="asis"`   | Useful for displaying tables in future packages that we will use                                    |  


----

<span style="color: #2980B9;">**Exercise**: Use the `comment=` option to preface the **R** output that gives the dimensions of `fhs` with ">" instead of "##". Also hide the code, but display the output in your report.</span> 

----

<details><summary>Answer:</summary>

```{r, comment=">", echo=FALSE}
dim(fhs)
```

> We only see the **R** output in the results document. The output is also prefaced with >.
</details>  
\  


**Global Chunk Options**

If you use the same set of chunk options throughout a document, you can set global chunk options at the top of the .Rmd file (see **code chunk 1** at the beginning of this .Rmd document).  For example, if we did not want to print any **R** code used in the analysis, we would set `echo=FALSE` in an initial code chunk by specifying `knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE)`.  


# Inline Code

*Warning*: I **love** inline coding and use it whenever I can. In my opinion, this is one of the best features of **R** Markdown for creating reports that need to be updated frequently. If you've ever received a "Whoops, I'm re-sending you the data file and need you to re-run THE. ENTIRE. ANALYSIS" e-mail from an investigator, you will learn to love this feature, as well. 

To embed **R** code in a line of text, surround the code with a pair of backticks and the letter `r`, e.g., <code><span>&#96;r round(mean(fhs$AGE), 2)&#96;</span></code>.  Using this in a sentence: the average age of individuals enrolled in the FHS at their first examination is `r round(mean(fhs$AGE), 2)`. Notice that inline code does not display the **R** commands, only their output.

----

<span style="color: #2980B9;">**Exercise**: Use my beloved inline coding to report the number of rows in the `fhs` data frame in a complete sentence. Remember the `nrow()` function.</span> 

----

<details><summary>Answer:</summary>

> The `fhs` data frame contains `r nrow(fhs)` rows.
</details>  
\  


# Plots

You can also embed plots in your report, e.g.,

```{r, fig.align="center", fig.width=4, fig.cap="Total Cholesterol at Exam 1 in Framingham Heart Study"}
hist(fhs$TOTCHOL, main="Total Cholesterol", xlab="Total Cholesterol")
```

**R** chunk options in the chunk header can set the figure dimensions, alignment, and specify the caption.  `{r fig.align="center", fig.width=4", fig.cap="Total Cholesterol at Exam 1 in Framingham Heart Study"}` was used in the figure above. Some commonly-used code chunk options for figures are given in the table below:


Option       |  Description                                          |
:-----------:|:------------------------------------------------------|
`fig.align`  | 'left', 'right' or 'center'                           |
`fig.cap`    | Figure caption                                        |
`fig.height` | Height in inches, `fig.height=5`                      |
`fig.width`  | Width in inches, `fig.width=7`                        |
`out.width`  | Graphics dimensions are scaled `out.width=50%`        |

You can display two plots one beside each other. Add `out.width=c('50%', '50%'), fig.show='hold'` to your chunk header. For example,

```{r, out.width=c('50%', '50%'), fig.show='hold', warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
ggplot(fhs, aes(x=AGE, y=SYSBP, color=factor(SEX, levels=c(1,2), labels=c("Male","Female")))) + 
  geom_point() + 
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE) + 
  labs(color = "Sex", x = "Age", y = "Systolic Blood Pressure")


ggplot(fhs, aes(x=factor(CURSMOKE, levels=c(0,1), labels=c("No","Yes")), y=SYSBP, fill=factor(SEX, levels=c(1,2), labels=c("Male","Female")))) + 
  geom_boxplot() +
  labs(fill = "Sex", x = "Current Smoker", y = "Systolic Blood Pressure")
```


# Table Formats

Numerical output appears as it would in the *Console* window (i.e., as plain text):

```{r}
head(fhs)[,1:10]  # head of first 10 columns of fhs
```

The `kable()` function in the `knitr` package formats printed tables. The primary input in the `kable()` function is a data frame. Note that you must load the `knitr` library (`library(knitr)`) before you are able to use the `knitr()` function that is in this package. See **code chunk 2** at the beginning of this .Rmd document where the `knitr` package is loaded. 

```{r}
kable(head(fhs)[,1:10])  # head of first 10 columns of fhs
```

The `kable()` function also allows you to rename the columns, round the numeric values, and set a table caption. Take a moment to understand what the code chunk below is doing.
 
```{r}
tab_01 = data.frame(
  Measure = c("Age", "Total Cholesterol", "Heart Rate"),
  N      = c(sum(!is.na(fhs$AGE)), sum(!is.na(fhs$TOTCHOL)), sum(!is.na(fhs$HEARTRTE))),
  MEAN   = c(mean(fhs$AGE, na.rm=TRUE), mean(fhs$TOTCHOL, na.rm=TRUE), mean(fhs$HEARTRTE, na.rm=TRUE)),
  SD     = c(sd(fhs$AGE, na.rm=TRUE), sd(fhs$TOTCHOL, na.rm=TRUE), sd(fhs$HEARTRTE, na.rm=TRUE)),
  MEDIAN = c(median(fhs$AGE, na.rm=TRUE), median(fhs$TOTCHOL, na.rm=TRUE), median(fhs$HEARTRTE, na.rm=TRUE))
)
tab_01

kable(
  tab_01,
  col.names = c("**Measure**", "**N**", "**Mean**", "**SD**", "**Median**"),
  digits = 2,
  caption = "Summary Statistics"
)
```


# Comments on Your First Lab Assignment

**Lab Assignment 0** has been uploaded to Canvas (`Lab0Assignment_2021.Rmd`), due on 02/14/2021. The purpose of this lab assignment is for you to gain experience with **R** Markdown. You will also review some commonly-used **R** functions that you should already be familiar with from EPH 505a. [If you're feeling rusty, please see **R-Review_2021.pdf** for an introduction to **R**.] In the lab assignment, you will also produce some descriptive statistics that you most likely covered in your previous course, but these functions will be reviewed in **Lab Session 1** on 02/08/2021. 

Save the `Rmd` file  (`Lab0Assignment_2021.Rmd`) to your `Lab0` folder and perform your work in that file.  You will be analyzing data (`hgb.csv`) from a study conducted to investigate the impact of herbicide exposure on maternal health. Before you can *knit* your `Lab0Assignment_2021.Rmd` **R** Markdown file for the first time, you must set your working directory and read in the `hgb.csv` data file (see lines 26-27 of `Lab0Assignment_2021.Rmd`).  We recommend that you save `hgb.csv` to your `Lab0` folder and set the `Lab0` folder as your WD.
